title: About
---

My name is Maggie. I'm a 33-yo woman, trying to get in the best shape of my life.
This is a a blog about my fitness journey, which spun as a sister blog of my "general ramblings" [blog](http://maggiesroom.net).
Writings here are a result of my own experience and the knowledge I've gathered from various sources over the years. 
Although a passionate fitness enthusiast, I am not a certified trainer, a nutritionist nor a health professional. 
I am not associated with any brands nor companies.
