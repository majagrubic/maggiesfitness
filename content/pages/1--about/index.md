My name is Maggie. I'm a 33-yo woman, trying to get in the best shape of my life. Fitness is my hobby, passion and inspiration.
I've started this blog about my fitness journey to share my enthusiasm with the world, in a hope to inspire people to be healthy and fit.
Ny goal is to one day own a gym that would have free membership for anyone who needs it.

Also checkout out my "general ramblings" [blog](http://maggiesroom.net).

Writings here are a result of my own experience and the knowledge I've gathered from various sources over the years. 
Although a passionate fitness enthusiast, I am not a certified trainer, a nutritionist nor a health professional. 
I am not associated with any brands nor companies.
