This morning I woke up to a shocking realization that we ran out of biscuits. Since it's not something we can't live without, it wasn't something worth going to the store for.
Given I have some extra time on my hands and love to try stuff, I thought I'd bake a healthier version of cookies for us.

### No sugar, no wheat flour, no baking powder
These cookies contain no processed sugar (except a bit from maple syrup) and no wheat flour. The base are milled oats and almond flour. Although quite low in carbs,
they contain a bit more fats, due to almond flour and coconut oil. 

### A few words about ingredients
I used vanilla whey, cause I love the neutral vanilla taste. You can boost the flavor by adding peanut butter, dried fruits or a banana. For grease, I used coconut oil, but 
a bit of butter or plain sunflower oil should do as well. Try to avoid olive oil for this one, as it has too strong of a taste. 
For a sweeter taste, I added some maple syrup because I LOVE it. You can substitute it for honey or leave it out all together, it will still taste good.

### Ingredients
* 1 egg
* 1 egg white
* 3 tbsp almond flour
* 50g milled oats 
* 2 tbsp coconut oil (melted)
* 1 scoop whey
* 1 drop vanilla extract
* 2 tsp maple syrup
* a bit of chia seeds *

\* When I combined all of the ingredients, the batter turned out a bit too watery. I added some chia seeds, to soak up extra moist, while keeping the texture compact.
You should be able to do without them.

#### Process 
This is super easy to make, you basically mix all the ingredients in a bowl and bakes about 10 minutes in a preheated oven (180*C). 
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C
2. Use a blender or a handheld mixer to mill the oats if needed; set aside

3. Put an egg + egg white in a bowl. Don't whisk yet.

5. Add oats. Mix again.
6. Add coconut oil, maple syrup and vanilla extract. Mix again. Add this point batter should be dense and thick, just a bit watery.

7. Add whey. Mix. If whey didn't soak up extra fluid, add chia seeds.

Lay out on a baking paper-coated tray and bake in a preaheated oven (180) for 10-15 minutes. They don't need a long baking time. 
Note: These will turn out soft and moist.

#### Macros
The batch contains about:
* 700 kcal
* protein: 50g
* fat: 32g
* carbs: 39g

Per-cookie macros depends on how many cookies you make from the batter. I managed to make 8 medium-sized cookies, which leaves us at:
* 87 kcal
* protein: 6g
* fat: 4g
* carbs: 5g

Let me know what these turned out for you.
