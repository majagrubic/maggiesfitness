It's Fat Tuesday and in Ireland this traditionally means - pancakes. I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to
experiment with pancake mixes that won't completely blow my macros out of proportions AND don't taste like a piece of paper.
In the past I've experimented with coconut flour, but today wanted to try the almond flour. I'm pretty happy with how this turned
out, so thought I'd share it.

#### Ingredients
* almond flour (2 full tbsp)
* wholewheat flour (1 full tbsp)
* whey (1 scoop)
* 1 whole egg
* 1 egg white
* almond milk (few drops)
* vanilla sugar or vanilla extract
* baking powder (1/2 tsp)
* coconut oil (for frying only)

#### A few words about ingredients
I use vanilla-flavored whey for pancake mixes, as it has the most neutral flavor, but obviously any other flavor will do.
For frying I love coconut oil, as it gives that subtle coconut taste, but of course it can be substituted with any other cooking oil or a non-stick spray.
Since almond flour is a bit higher in fats than regular flour, I've decided to mix it with regular wholewheat flour, to keep the balance of fats/carbs a bit better. To further cut down on fats,
a whole egg can probably be substituted with just an egg white, but I haven't tried that. Vanilla sugar can be replaced with sugar-free syrup or pure vanilla extract, to cut down on carbs.

#### Servings
In my medium-sized frying pan, the mixture above made 3 decently-sized fluffy pancakes. I think these would be even better made smaller.
I love topping mine with fruit and real Canadian maple syrup (it's called "Fat Tuesday" for a reason, ok? :smiley:).

#### Macros
Exact macros will of course depend on the flours/whey and quantities you use. My batch had roughly:
* protein: 41g
* fat: 28g
* carbs: 20g

This does not include frying oil nor topping.
##### Per pancake:
* protein: 13g
* fat: 9g
* carbs: 7g

Not bad for a delicious breakfast :yum:
