You made a decision to start going to the gym. Congratulations! This is the best decision you will ever make. When I was first starting,
I spent a lot of money on unnecessary training programs and supplements that don't work. I spent time on exercises that didn't benefit me. I ended up injured.
To save you from the same pain, I decided to put together this small list of the things I wish I knew before I had started.

### Nutrition is the key
Admittedly, that one I DID know. However, I thought it didn't apply to me. My entire life I had been eating more or less clean -
lean meat, a lot of fish, veggies, complex carbs... In my family, a trip to fast food was done on national holidays, maybe twice a year.
So when I started working out I thought that my regular diet is enough to keep me going. How wrong I was! Even when training consistently and following a proper exercise plan, I still couldn't make progress. That's when I paid a nutrition coach to do 
a meal plan for me. It turned out I was eating 50% less than I was supposed to! Whatever your goal is - to lose fat, to gain muscle,
to do both - food is your fuel. You will need to be equally diligent and organized with what you eat the same as you will need to be in the gym.

### Aim for progress over perfection
This one took me a long long time to fully implement. I would decide that from Monday I'm eating 100% clean and go to the gym every day. I would buy all this nice food and by Thursday/Friday
I would be eating pizzas, cakes, burgers, because my body was craving all the fatty/sugary food. It takes a while for a body to adjust to the new diet/exercise regimen. 
The smaller the changes, the easier the adjustment. The key is to be patient and be consistent. Good thing to remember - nobody eats 100% clean, except maybe physique competitors, but even they do it for a limited period of time.
In order for nutrition plan to stick, it needs to be maintainable, and maintainable means eating the foods you like. The rule that most fitness experts
recommend is 80/20 - 80% clean, 20% whatever. It took me a long long time to get this nailed down. Now I treat food as fuel (yes, I eat endless amounts of chicken breasts and veggies), but also enjoy fried/fatty/sugary food from time to time.

### Count macros
What are macros? Simplified, macronutrients ("macros" for shorts) are the 3 major components of food: proteins, carbohydrates and fats (as opposed to micronutrients - eg. vitamins and minerals).
How many of each you need is very individual - it depends on your height, weight, regular activity levels, training regimen, goals... Spend some time researching this out and understanding this topic.
Then get your macros calculated. There's a Macros Inc. Facebook group that offers free macros calculations. It's a good place to get started.  For tracking, a lot of people use MyFitnessPal, which is also free. 
There are some paid apps (RP strength) that do macros calculations and tracking. I've personally paid someone to do macro splits for me, and I'm tracking them in a notebook (I'm old-school, what can I say). What I don't like about
MyFitnessPal is that you need to log the entire meal (eg. 200g of chicken, 50g of potatoes), which I find time-consuming. When logging macros in my notebook I just log how much of each I've had, so basically just three numbers.

### Don't be afraid of the weights section
Now that you've gotten the nutrition part nailed down, you're ready to hit the gym. And you're petrified that everyone will look at you and laugh at you cause you have no idea what you're doing.
I get it - sometimes you'll be the only woman in the weights room (happened to me quite a few time) and there will be "big guys" pumping iron and big guys are
intimidating. Let me tell you something - "big guys" know exactly how much effort they invested to get where they are now and they are not looking down on anyone willing do the effort. Generally,
nobody serious about their workout has any time/energy left to study what you're doing. If they do - it speaks more about them than it does about you. If you do get a rude look/comment,
brush it off and continue your day. Same as you would if you got an angry driver honking at you while you're waiting to turn. 
PS. Weights don't make you look bulky, they make you look sexy and strong!

### Get a trainer
Getting a personal trainer is a great place to start. Talk to them about your goals and let them figure out what exercise routine is the best for you. If you have money,
a personal trainer is the best investment you can make. If you don't, most gyms include a free session with one of the trainers in there - make use of that. Online 
coaches are a cheaper alternative, but I've never used one of those, so I can't speak about how effective that is.

### Don't get a trainer
Following my own advice, before I got serious about the gym, I decided to get a trainer. I got a first one I found - the location was convenient, halfway between
work and home, and they had good reviews on Google. I was ready to cash out a lot of money and do the work. It turned out the person was very young and inexperienced,
and the training was not personal at all. All they did was yell at me to go faster/stronger, not respecting my limits at all. One month in I ended up badly injured and was out of the gym for 2 months.
Lesson learned. Before you get a trainer, talk to them. Ask about their qualifications, their clients, their training style. Ask for an intro session if possible.
See how you click. If you don't find one that you feel is a good match for you, save the money and don't get a trainer. Trainer can really make it or break it.

### Don't buy cookie-cutter programs
So you didn't get a coach and are looking for a place to start. You'll be bombarded with a bunch of athletes/Instagram celebrities/people with a strong PR behind them/ selling their workout programs. After my coach fiasco,
I spent some money getting a few of these programs. Let me tell you something - most of them are crap, with no structure nor knowledge behind them. Save the money! That being said,
there are some really knowledgeable people out there who know what they are doing and have some amazing programs. I am currently following Jeff Cavaliere's (AthelanX) program and it's amazing. But even his starter
program is made for people who have been in the gym for a while and somewhat know what they are doing. Bret Contreras is another one worth checking out. If you're getting a program, make sure it's made for beginners 
and that it will be sustainable for you.

### So where do I start?
Group sessions in the gym are a good place to get you going, develop a routine, build some foundation. Youtube is an endless source of information. Check out Scott Herman videos
on how to perform pretty much any exercise correctly. Go to the gym and practice, practice, practice. Stick to bodyweight exercises until you feel you have the move nailed down. Use the stick. 
Then use the barbell. Then start adding weights.

### How heavy should I lift?
This one I struggled with the most. I got the move nailed down, built some endurance but I was always wondering - how much should I lift? And I couldn't figure this one out.
If I don't lift heavy enough, I won't get stronger. If I lift too heavy, I'll get injured and again, won't get stronger. Unfortunately - the truth is - you lift as heavy as you can without compromising the form.
This is the key and something that I've struggled with a lot. The lesson for me was that we start in accordance with our abilities and then build up from there. Patience and consistence over
one-time successes, always. 

### Supplements is a profitable industry
Beware that supplements industry is a very profitable one, with a lot of snake oil and false promises. 
If you have the nutrition nailed down, you DON'T NEED anything else to get you going. Once you get in the groove of it all and see where your weak points are you can start experimenting with and adding supplements.
But by then you will hopefully know what you're looking for and where to look. 

### Be patient
In the past, I would start my new fitness regime and expect to have perfectly defined abs by the time I go on vacation in three months. Guess what, it never happened. 
And since I didn't have abs by the time I went to the beach, there was no point in continuing the fitness regimen. I was caught in this vicious cycle until I slowly realized all of what I had written above. To summarize:
   1. Fat loss is a slow process
   2. Gaining muscle is an even slower one
   3. All beginnings are hard
   4. It starts with nutrition
   5. It's about consistency, not perfection
   6. It takes a lot of training in the gym to get the technique perfected
   7. It's about progress, not perfection
   8. Don't waste money on things that don't matter
   9. There are no shortcuts
  10. If you show up and do the work, results will show
  11. Don't compare yourself to Instagram influencers
  12. Don't compare yourself to anyone

It took me a solid year to get visible results on my body.
It took me about 6 months to feel I am ready to start increasing the weight on the deadlifts. 
I am still doing overhead presses with just a bar as I don't feel ready to add weights.

### Enjoy
Whatever you do, this should be an enjoyable journey. Don't forget to have fun!
