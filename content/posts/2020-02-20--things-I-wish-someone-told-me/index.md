You made a decision to start going to the gym. Congratulations! This is the best decision you will ever make. When I was first starting,
I spent a lot of money of unnecessary training programs and supplements that don't work. I spent time on exercises that didn't benefit me. I ended up injured.
To save you from the same pain, I decided to put together this small FAQ.

#### Nutrition is the key
Admittedly, that one I WAS told. However, I thought it didn't apply to me. My entire life I had been eating more or less clean -
lean meat, a lot of fish, veggies, complex carbs... In my family, a trip to fast food was done on national holidays, maybe once a year, 
for us kids to get a feel of it. So when I started working out, I thought that my regular diet is enough to keep me going.
Wrong! Even when training consistently and following a proper exercise plan, I still couldn't make progress. That's when I paid a nutrition coach to do 
a meal plan for me. It turned out I was eating 50% less than I was supposed to! Whatever your goal is - to lose fat, to gain muscle,
to do both, to maintain - food is your fuel. You will need to be eq diligent and organized with what you eat the same as you will need to be in the gym.

#### Aim for progress over perfection
This one took me a long long time to implement fully. I would decide that from Monday I'm eating 100% clean and in line with my macros. I would buy all this nice food and by Thursday/Friday
I would be eating pizzas, cakes, burgers... my body was craving all the fatty/sugary food. Starting a new diet regimen takes time for body to adjust. Be patient and be consistent.
Nobody eats 100% clean, except maybe people competing in physique competitions, but even they do it for a limited period of time.
In order for nutrition plan to be consistent, it needs to be maintainable, and maintainable means eating the foods you like. The rule that most fitness experts
recommend is 80/20 - 80% clean, 20% whatever. So for example, having a pizza for lunch every day will break 80/20 rule, but having a slice(!) of pizza once a week is perfectly acceptable.

#### Count macros
What are macros? Simplified, macro nutrients are the 3 big groups that our body needs: proteins, carbohydrates and fats (as opposed to micronutrients - vitamins and minerals).
How many of each you need is very individual - depends on your height, weight, regular activity levels, training regimen, goals... Try to get someone to do it for you. There's a free Macros Inc.
facebook group and they offer macros calculations. For tracking, a lot of people use MyFitnessPal, which is also free. 
There are some paid apps (RP strength) that do macros calculations and . I've personally paid someone to do that for me, and I'm tracking them in a notebook (oldschool I know). What I don't like about
MyFitnessPal is that you need to log the entire meal (eg. 200g of chicken, 50g of potatoes), which I find time consuming. When logging macros in my notebook I just log how much of each I've had, so it's just three numbers.

### Don't be afraid of the gym
Now that you've gotten the nutrition part nailed down, you're ready to hit the gym. And you're petrified that everyone will look at you and laugh at you cause you have no idea what you're doing.
I get it - sometimes you'll be the only woman in the weights room (happened to me quite a few time) and all around you will be "big guys" pumping iron and big guys are
intimidating. Let me tell you something - big guys know how much effort they invested to get into where they are now and they are not looking down on anyone willing do invest effort in getting fit. As a rule of thumb,
nobody serious about their workout has any time/energy left to study what you're doing. If they do - it speaks more about them than it does about you. If you do get a rude look/comment,
brush it off and continue your day. Same as you would if you got an angry driver honking at you while you're waiting to turn.
