One question I often see asked in the fitness groups I follow is - "I'm going through some difficult time (divorce, death of a family member) and I've stopped working out.
How do I motivate myself?". My answer is always the same:

> You don't

Please let me explain.

####

Fitness is about wellbeing - both physical and emotional. It's about finding balance. For me, weight-lifting is a part of my balance. So is my relationship,
my family, my friends, my job, my health, my home, my other hobbies... The balance is distorted when one or more of those things suddenly require significantly more attention.
For example, right now, I'm struggling with some injuries and I'm going through some tough time emotionally. I find the bare minimum of energy to do my job. The rest of the time I just sleep.
I sleep 10 - 13h a day and I still feel exhausted. Forcing myself to go to the gym in this state won't bring the equilibrium back, it will only further distort the balance. So I'm not going to the gym.

> And it's okay

Lifting weights requires a tremendous amount of effort - both physical and emotional. You need to breathe properly. Activate the muscles. Focus on the lift. All the while you're fighting 
your fibres, your nerves, your joints, your tendons and of course - the gravity itself. Your body is in the gym, but your mind is someplace else; somewhere isolated; somewhere where it can 
more easily ignore the inputs telling it it will fail. You inhale and everything slows down. Three seconds on the outside feel like three years on the inside. 
I don't have that amount of energy to invest now. My focus is elsewhere.

> Taking two weeks off to deal with emotional storm won't hinder my progress. It will speed it up.

Of course, there's a difference between taking 2 weeks off and taking 2 years off. When the situation is back under control, I go back. 
To make going back easier, some of the things I still try to be mindful about in the meantime are:

#### Staying consistent with my nutrition
I still need to eat and what I eat now will further speed up or set back my comeback. I continue eating fairly clean, getting plenty of protein and counting macros.

#### Light cardio
Staying active is always a good idea. I try to do some light cardio for 20-25 minutes every day, to get the blood flowing and relieve some tension from a lot of sitting.

#### Corrective exercises
Now is the perfect time to do a lot of stretching, balance and corrective exercises. I do all the single-leg exercises I hate (bodyweight only).
I take the stick and work on improving my form. I've joined a pilates class. Fixing imbalances and working on flexibility is always a good idea, it's just I too
often disregard them.

#### Relax
The point is to relax the body AND the mind at the same time. Like meditation. Or a massage. 
Unfortunately, I'm to ticklish too be able to enjoy a massage, so I've opted for acupuncture. I'm really curious to see what effects it will have on me (if any). I'm hoping to write more about this after 2 or 3 sessions.

But the most important thing I try to do is:

#### Go easy on myself
Life happens. And it's okay.
