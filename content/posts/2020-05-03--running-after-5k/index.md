Yesterday, we got the announcement that the gyms would remain closed until August. I was really bummed.
When the whole quarantine thing started, I was feeling a bit drained and my motivation to go the gym was low. I jumped on an opportunity to try new activities, 
discover new ways to keep active (like [skipping rope](https://maggiesfitness.net/skipping-rope-workout/)), fix some imbalances in my body and I was really enjoying it. 
But now I'm at the point where I really miss it. I have no equipment at home, mostly because I live in an apartment and I don't want to clutter my already small living space with equipment. 
I guess it was a good idea to start running again, cause it seems we will be running for a while.
     
In one of my previous [posts](https://maggiesfitness.net/running-basics/) I disclosed a 0-5k running program. 
If you are following it, you'll soon reach that 5k. This brings the natural question - what is next? Don't worry, this post brings you 5-15k running program.
   
Before we get to the actual program, let's see what you'll need:

#### Good running shoes
I seriously cannot emphasize the importance of good running shoes. As you will be increasing running time/distance, shoes will make it or break it.
If you want to continue running (and can afford it financially), invest in good running shoes. They may not be a lifesaver, but they will be a tendonsaver.

### Sticking to a plan
It may not be immediately obvious that sticking to a running plan is as important as sticking to weight training plan, but trust me - 
the plan is designed to get you running safely. In addition to that, it gives you that nice sense of accomplishment when you tick off a section.     
Last weekend, I was feeling especially breezy and was hit by a runner's high. I decided to keep on running, ending up with a bit under 12k. I was so exhausted that night I could barely get up from the couch. Secondly,
my knee started to hurt. For the past week, it's been a nagging reminder of that endeavour of mine. So much about listening to my own advice, heh.

### Cross-training
Running is an activity that mainly utilizes quads, calf muscles, glutes, hamstrings and hip flexors. A lot of runners have disproportionately strong quads compared to their hamstrings. The purpose of cross-training is not only to prevent that imbalance, but also to strengthen the secondary muscles used (running, so you can run faster and pain-free.
In my last post I promised you a calf-strengthening exercises. I haven't forgotten about that, it's just that I had a really tough week, the one where I haven't been doing those
exercises. It would feel like cheating posting them here. I will put up a post with a good at-home cross-training for runners (including calf muscle exercises), I promise.
In the meantime - yoga is also great on your rest days. While I'm personally not a great yoga fan, I think it's great to stretch tight muscles and 
strengthen the core muscles, which I hate training otherwise. 
 
### One long run a week
The plan revolves around doing 5ks during the week, with one long(er) run a week. Normally, longer runs are done at the weekend, as this is when you are most rested.
However, as always, make the plan suit your schedule. Just keep the number of no-running days and cross-training days consistent. 
 
### A good diet
One thing to keep in mind is that the diet for running is quite a bit different than for weight training. I know it may be obvious, but it took me a while to adjust my nutrition when
I changed my activities. Since the start of the quarantine, I lost 3 kgs. No training with heavy weights in addition to increase in cardio activites resulted in some muscle and weight loss.
Over the past two weeks, I've adjusted my macros quite significantly, reduced the protein and increased the carbs (replaced that post-workout protein shake with a post-run beer :grimacing:)    
Carbs are especially important the night before the long run - ideally, the dinner will be light and based on carbs.
