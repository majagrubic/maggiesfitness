I originally had another post planned for today, but something weird happened in the meantime. This afternoon I dressed up to go to the gym. Leggings, sports bra, tank top, a hoodie - I was ready.
But I hesitated. I sat down and had a monologue with myself if I should go. That's when I decided that today's post would be about something that's on everyone's mind lately - the coronavirus outbreak.

#### Careful, but not paranoid
I've been trying to follow this rule for a while now. I cancelled my upcoming trip. My partner and I agreed we'd cut down on all leisure activities - no dinners, no pubs, no cinemas. 
I work from home anyway. Groceries get delivered. I rarely use public transport. So really, the only high-risk activity remaining in my life is going to the gym. Today I had been pondering a lot if this is 
something I should cut out completely too? Can I stay careful, but not cut into the paranoia territory? 

#### Gyms are known as the bacteria nesting place
Enclosed space where everyone sweats and drips their sweat over everything they touch is gross even under normal circumstances. Barbell is full of bacteria on a regular day. Don't even get me started on the mats.
I'm not easily freaked out by those things, but I do wash my hands even in between exercises even on a regular day. However, there is just no way that I can spend an hour in the gym and wash my hands every time I need to scratch my face.
My body sweats, my hair sticks to my sweaty face, it itches and I just need to scratch it. A sweat drops hits my eye and all my precaution goes to waste there and then.

#### It's the risk I'm willing to take
And yet, I still go. I am a true believer that a fit body will more easily fight off an infection. Since developing a regular gym-going routine, I've witnessed numerous times how well my body responded to things that would have otherwise wrecked it.
If anything, my body needs exercise now more than ever. Of course, if I start feeling unwell, I will stop going immediately, not to put others at risk.
That being said, yesterday I went for a run. Like an actual run outside, in the rain, for the first time in almost two years :sweat_smile: My feet were in agony, but the fresh air suited me. 
I'm planning on introducing more outdoor activities over the next few days/weeks, even if it's just going outside to do a few air squats / burpees / pushups.

#### It's probable the gym will be closed soon
To this day, there have been around 40 cases reported in Ireland, with the risk still being "low to moderate". Still, all the major events/concerts have been cancelled (goodbye St. Patrick's parade). I assume the gym
is going to close as well if the situation progresses. Then we will be left with no choice but to stick at home. I've already started looking into the crazy things you can do in an apartment. 
Yesterday I tried doing a few hops with a jumping rope (sorry neighbours). But all I keep thinking about is [this guy](https://twitter.com/FloTrack/status/1227971942310973442). He ran for almost 5 hours, accumulating almost 50km, all while being in his apartment during a lockdown:

So much about excuses for not getting that daily mileage in :sweat_smile:

It's undeniable that there are some interesting times ahead of us. Whatever happens, I hope we get through this quickly and safely!
