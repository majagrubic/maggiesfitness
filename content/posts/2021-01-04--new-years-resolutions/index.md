It's that time of the year, the time for making New Year's resolutions. I had already made mine: to contribute to this blog more consistently :smiley:

Many of you will make a New Year's resolution to start eating healthy / exercise regularly / go to the gym. With gyms closed, I am not
sure the last one is an option at the moment :grimacing: But for those of you who are in the process of making any kind of fitness-related resolution,
here are some tips on how not to give up on those resolutions by the end of January (or even sooner).

1. Choose an activity you like

With gyms around the world closed, this is the perfect opportunity to try out different things and see what you like. A lot of fitness coaches offer free online content.
Try a dance session. Bodyweight training. A yoga class. Go for a run. Go for a hike. Choose an activity that *you* like and the chances are you will stick to it.

2. Have a plan

Once you've picked your activity (or activities), it's important to have a plan, at least until the routine sticks.
The plan needs to be tailored to your skill level. DO NOT and I will repeat this always and forever, do not buy cookie-cutter programs.
I see many athletes and Instagram celebrities offering "exact blueprint" of how they train as a program to purchase. Are you an experienced athlete with 10+ years
of training at least 3-4 time a week? If yes, absolutely go for it, the program is indeed suited for your skill level. If not, skip them.
They will leave you demotivated at best, and injured at worst.

3. Don't go too fast too soon

This goes hand in hand with a previous bullet point. Making an unrealistic expectation to go from 0 to exercising 6 days a week will make you feel drained, tired and more likely to give up.
You shouldn't attempt a spiderman push-up if you can't make a single (or 10 for that matter) regular push-ups. Understand where you are at and where you would like to be. Start with 2-3 days a week (with rest days in between),
then gradually add more days as your body gets used to the exercise. Incorporate long walks into your exercise regimen; your body, and your mind, will be grateful.

4. Make time in your schedule

Don't expect to exercise when you'll have time. Instead, make time. Book a slot in your day and commit to it. Exercising around the same time each day helps
both to create the routine and helps the body to adjust more easily. Don't worry if exercising around the same time is not an option; as long as you dedicate a time slot and stick to it, it will be fine.
Also, please note that if your only time to exercise is at 6am, and you're not even awake by 6am at this point, don't expect to go out of bed straight to the treadmill and
find it enjoyable. Instead of jumping out of bed straight to exercising, start by waking up 15min earlier every day until you reach a desired wake-up time. Once you are awake, have a coffee, read newspapers, go for a walk.
Get your body (and your mind) used to the new waking time. After you had successfully done that for a week, start doing your planned exercise.

5. Wear gym clothes

I know this goes without saying when we're all going to the gym, but when exercising at home I find that it's still important to keep this distinction. Changing to sportswear will likely make
you feel more motivated and make it that harder to give up. Likewise, changing back to regular clothes will give you a sense of accomplishment.

6. Have support from people around you

New habits take a while to form and stick. The more support you have from people around you, the less likely you'll feel tempted to fall into the old behaviors.
Understand that not everyone will be supportive of this new lifestyle and that you may lose a few people along the way. But I promised you it will be worth it!

Whatever you do - don't forget to have fun. Also, check my blog post about [starting my own fitness journey](https://maggiesfitness.net/things-I-wish-someone-told-me/) and what had learned since then.

Happy new year!
